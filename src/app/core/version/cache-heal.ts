/**
 * Wipes `index.html` cache entries poisoned before `742edc4`.
 *
 * Between the first deploy (2026-08-13) and the `no-cache` fix (2026-08-28) the
 * hosting served `index.html` with `max-age=31536000`. Browsers that loaded the
 * portal in that window stored the entry point with a one-year TTL, and a
 * *fresh* entry is never revalidated. Measured on the sibling panel
 * (`dominodo.admin`, same hosting and same window) with Cloudflare RUM:
 * `dt: "cache"`, `transferSize: 0` on a cold load of `/`. Not a slow request or
 * a 304 — no request. Nothing the server puts on `/` can reach those users, and
 * they keep booting the August build until 2027.
 *
 * Overwriting the entry is unreliable, so this deletes it instead. Fetching
 * `RESET_URL` — a URL too new to be in anyone's cache, so always a real
 * request — returns `Clear-Site-Data: "cache"`, which makes the browser drop
 * the whole origin cache, poisoned entry included. The next navigation to `/`
 * has nothing to reuse and must go to the network.
 *
 * Multi-tenancy note: `Clear-Site-Data` is scoped to the origin, so each tenant
 * subdomain repairs itself independently — which is what we want, and why only
 * `"cache"` is cleared. `"storage"` would drop the session on that tenant.
 *
 * Costs the user one re-download of the hashed bundles, once, ever.
 * Best-effort: never blocks bootstrap, never surfaces an error.
